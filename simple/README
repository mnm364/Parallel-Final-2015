This is the final project for Parallel Programming (600.420) Spring 2015.

Our goal for this project was to find the parallelism possible from
the Intel SPMD Program Compiler available in a lower-level functional
units instead of parallelism through cores (OpenMP) and machines (MPI).

The following files are contained within this submission:
    simple.cpp : Driver class with serial implementation of our tests
    simple.ispc : ISPC parallelized implementation of our tests
    random.cpp : Creates random numbers in a text file
    io/rand01.txt : 1,000,000 random numbers
    io/rand02.txt : 1,000,000 different random numbers
    makefile : makefile

Our project depends on the ISPC library. We have included it in the tar.
